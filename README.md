## Overview

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple way to keep an eye on several simultaneously running EVE Online clients and to easily switch between them. While running it shows a set of live thumbnails for each of the active EVE Online clients. These thumbnails allow fast switch to the corresponding EVE Online client either using mouse or configurable hotkeys.

It's essentially a task switcher, it does not relay any keyboard/mouse events and suchlike. The application works with EVE, EVE through Steam, or any combination thereof.

If you have questions come to the Discord and chat.

Discord: https://discord.gg/xYt8R9AFXB

The program does NOT (and will NOT ever) do the following things:

* modify EVE Online interface
* display modified EVE Online interface
* broadcast any keyboard or mouse events
* anyhow interact with EVE Online except of bringing its main window to foreground or resizing/minimizing it

## How To Install & Use

1. Download and extract the contents of the .zip archive to a location of your choice (ie: Desktop, CCP folder, etc)
..* **Note**: Please do not install the application into the *Program Files* or *Program files (x86)* folders. These folders in general do not allow applications to write anything there while EVE-O Preview now stores its configuration file next to its executable, thus requiring the write access to the folder it is installed into.
2. Start up both EVE-O Preview and your EVE Clients (the order does not matter)
3. Adjust settings as you see fit. Program options are described below

## Development Details
We have migrated to a unified source code where Windows and Linux share the same code base. When doing do we also implemented the ability to build the source using Github Actions. If you would like to make changed to the code for yourself, fork this repo, make changes to the code as you see fit and actions will build the .exe files. If you would like to share your code changes with the community open a PR for approval.

## System Requirements

* Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11, Linux Wine
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8+
* EVE clients Display Mode should be set to **Fixed Window** or **Window Mode**. **Fullscreen** mode is not supported.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Hotkey Setup

It is possible to set a key combinations to immediately jump to certain EVE window. However currently EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these hotkeys. It should be done via editing the configuration file directly. Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

**Note**: Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **ClientHotkey**. Most probably it will look like

    "ClientHotkey": {},

This means that no hotkeys are defined. Edit it to be like

    "ClientHotkey": {
      "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah": "F1",
      "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette": "F2"
    }

This simple edit will assign **F1** as a hotkey for Phrynohyas Tig-Rah and **F2** as a hotkey for Ondatra Patrouette, so pressing F1 anywhere in Windows will immediately open EVE client for Phrynohyas Tig-Rah if he is logged on.

The following hotkey is described as `modifier+key` where `modifier` can be **Control**, **Alt**, **Shift**, or their combination. F.e. it is possible to setup the hotkey as

    "ClientHotkey": {
      "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah": "F1",
      "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette": "Control+Shift+F4"
    }

**Note:** Do not set hotkeys to use the key combinations already used by EVE. It won't work as "_I set hotkey for my DPS char to F1 and when I'll press F1 it will automatically open the DPS char's window and activate guns_". Key combination will be swallowed by EVE-O Preview and NOT retranslated to EVE window. So it will be only "_it will automatically open the DPS char's window_".

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Cycle Clients with Hotkey Setup

In a similar pattern to the per client Hotkey Setup, It is possible to set a key combinations to cycle through select Eve Windows. EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these hotkeys. It should be done via editing the configuration file directly. Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

If you have not run EVE-O Preview before, or since this feature was added then it is recommended to quickly open and close EVE-O Preview once to trigger the config to update with some sample values. 

**Note**: Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entries **CycleGroup1ForwardHotkeys** and **CycleGroup1BackwardHotkeys**. Most probably it will look like

    "CycleGroup1ForwardHotkeys": [
      "F14",
      "Control+F14"
    ],
    "CycleGroup1BackwardHotkeys": [
      "F13",
      "Control+F13"
    ]

**Note**: It is highly recommended to leave the Hotkey values as default and bind them with a gaming device if you can support it.

Next find the entry **CycleGroup1ForwardHotkeys**. Most probably it will look like

    "CycleGroup1ClientsOrder": {
      "EVE - Example DPS Toon 1": 1,
      "EVE - Example DPS Toon 2": 2,
      "EVE - Example DPS Toon 3": 3
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example DPS Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The numbers on the right are used to force the order in which they cycle.
If a character appears in the list but is not currently logged in, then it will simply be skipped.
If a character does not appear in the list, then they will never become active when cycling clients.
If "EVE" is used instead of a character name - then this is taken to mean active clients with no active character (ie on character selection screen). This would allow you to setup a cycle group to go through clients at character selection screen. EVE-O Preview will cycle through all clients in this state.
If no clients defined here but Hotkeys are defined then ALL active clients will be cycled through with those hotkeys.

By now you may have noticed that there are multiple groups. The above configuration can be followed for a second group by using the values **CycleGroup2ForwardHotkeys**, **CycleGroup2BackwardHotkeys**, and **CycleGroup2ForwardHotkeys**
This may provide useful if you want to have one HotKey to cycle through a group of DPS characters, while another HotKey cycles through support roles such as gate scouts, or a group of logi. Cyclegroups are numbered 1 through 5.

Alternatively you may not want to use any of these HotKeys. Please note that deleting the values in their entirety will simply result in them being automatically re-generated.
Should you wish to remove these HotKeys completely, Simply set the values to empty, such as the example below:

    "CycleGroup1ForwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup1BackwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup1ClientsOrder": {},
	  "CycleGroup2ForwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup2BackwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup2ClientsOrder": {},
	  "CycleGroup3ForwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup3BackwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup3ClientsOrder": {},
	  "CycleGroup4ForwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup4BackwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup4ClientsOrder": {},
	  "CycleGroup5ForwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup5BackwardHotkeys": [],
	  "CycleGroup5ClientsOrder": {}

### Minimize All Clients with Hotkey Setup

In a similar pattern to the per client Hotkey Setup, It is possible to set a key combinations to Minimize all the Eve Windows. EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these hotkeys. It should be done via editing the configuration file directly. Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

  "MinimizeAllClientsHotkeys": [
    "F22"
  ],


**Hints** 
* Minimise the use of modifiers or standard keys to minimise issues with the client playing up. In the default example unusual Function keys (e.g. F14) are used which are then bound to a game pad or gaming mouse.
* The Eve client can be somewhat less than stable, often getting confused as client focus switches. It is near certain that you will experience issues such as keys sticking or even in some cases D-Scan running each time the client swaps. So far I have found no perfect solution and opt for the most stable solution instead, of sticking to the F14+ keys.
* For the best experience try to use the Control modifier. In the default example F14 is used to cycle to the next client, but if pressed mid locking a target (Control + Clicking) then the client will not cycle. By registering Control+F4 as an additional hotkey, the client will cycle.
* For a list of supported keys, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys

### Per Client Border Color
Have you ever wanted your main client to show up in a different color so that it more easily catches your eye? Or maybe your Logi to stand out?

EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these per client overrides as yet. Though, It can be done via editing the configuration file directly. 
**Note** Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **PerClientActiveClientHighlightColor**. Most probably it will look like

    "PerClientActiveClientHighlightColor": {
      "EVE - Example Toon 1": "Red",
      "EVE - Example Toon 2": "Green"
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The names on the right represent which highligh color to use for that clients border.

If a client does not appear in this list, then it will use the global highlight color by default.

**Hint** For a list of supported colors see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.color#properties

### Per Client Thumbnail Size
Would you like to have different clients with different thumbnail sizes ?

EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these per client overrides as yet. Though, It can be done via editing the configuration file directly. 
**Note** Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **PerClientThumbnailSize**. Most probably it will look like

    "PerClientThumbnailSize": {
      "EVE - Example Toon 1": "240, 180",
      "EVE - Example Toon 2": "200, 100",
      "EVE": "320, 240"
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The values on the right represent the size of the thumbnail.

If a client does not appear in this list, then it will use the global thumbnail size by default.

### Per Client Zoom Anchor
Would you like to have different clients with different ZoomAnchor for each thumbnail ?

EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these per client overrides as yet. Though, It can be done via editing the configuration file directly. 
**Note** Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **PerClientZoomAnchor**. Most probably it will look like

    "PerClientZoomAnchor": {
      "EVE - Example Toon 1": 1,
      "EVE - Example Toon 2": 2,
      "EVE": 3
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The values on the right represent the Zoom Anchor for the thumbnail (which sets the starting point of the thumbnail zoom).
Valid values are 0-8 : 0-NW, 1-North, 2-NE, 3-West, 4-Center, 5-East, 6-SW, 7-South, 8-SE.

If a client does not appear in this list, then it will use the global Zoom Anchor by default.

### Per Client Prevent Preview
Would you like to prevent previews of some clients, or enforce preview of some clients ?

EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these per client overrides as yet. Though, It can be done via editing the configuration file directly. 
**Note** Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **PerClientZoomAnchor**. Most probably it will look like

  "PerClientPreventPreviews": {
      "EVE - Example Toon 1": false,
      "EVE - Example Toon 2": true
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The values on the right allow you to enforce always showing preview (if not minimized) or never showing preview.

If a client does not appear in this list, then it will use the global Prevent Preview by default.

### Per Client Prevent Preview Color
Would you like different background colors for specific clients when you prevent preview on those clients ?

EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these per client overrides as yet. Though, It can be done via editing the configuration file directly. 
**Note** Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **PerClientPreventPreviewColor**. Most probably it will look like

"PerClientPreventPreviewColor": {
      "EVE - Example Toon 1": "Red",
      "EVE - Example Toon 2": "Blue"
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The values on the right allow you to set a background color for when that client has prevent preview true (either Per Client or global). Do NOT select #000001 else you will be clashing with Transparency settings.

If a client does not appear in this list, then it will use the global Prevent Preview Color by default.

### Per Client Alias
Would you like something other than the character name to appear in the preview window ? Maybe you want Main, Scout, Miner1,Miner2,etc... or just wish to hide your toon names when streaming on Eve-O-Previews....

EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these per client overrides as yet. Though, It can be done via editing the configuration file directly. 
**Note** Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **PerClientAliases**. Most probably it will look like

"PerClientAliases": {
      "EVE - Example Toon 1": "Main",
      "EVE - Example Toon 2": "Alt"
    }

You should modify this entry with a list of each of your clients replacing "Example Toon 1", etc with the name of your character. The values on the right allow you to set a label for the preview overlay. 

If a client does not appear in this list, then it will use the actual toon name.

### Compatibility Mode

This setting allows to enable an alternate thumbnail render. This render doesn't use advanced DWM API to create live previews. Instead it is a screenshot-based render with the following pros and cons:
* `+`  Should work even in remote desktop environments
* `-`  Consumes significantly more memory. In the testing environment EVE-O Preview did consume around 180 MB to manage 3 thumbnails using this render. At the same time the primary render did consume around 50 MB when run in the same environment.
* `-`  Thumbnail images are refreshed at 1 FPS rate
* `-`  Possible short mouse cursor freezes

### Release build

Release builds are generated using github actions when a release is created from tag. If you wish to build locally the variable EVEOTARGET controls Linux or Windows source inclusion.

You can build using : 

* dotnet build src\\Eve-O-Preview\\Eve-O-Preview.csproj --configuration Release -p:EVEOTARGET="Linux" -p:AssemblyVersion="8.0.2.0"
* dotnet build src\\Eve-O-Preview\\Eve-O-Preview.csproj --configuration Release   -p:EVEOTARGET="Windows" -p:AssemblyVersion="8.0.2.0"
